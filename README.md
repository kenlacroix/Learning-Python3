#### Python3 Topics Learned So Far ####

- **Lists**
- **Loops**
- **Strings**
- **Functions**
- **Control Flow (loops: if, while, etc.)
- **Booleans**

#### Games of Chance (CodeAcademy Project)

###### Description

4 games of simulated gambling. The main purpose of the project is to understand
and apply functions, if/elif/else/while loops and logic.

- **Coin Toss:** Heads or Tails.
- **Cho-Han:** Two die are rolled, user guesses the whether the result will be
odd or even.
- **Two Card Draw:** Highest card wins.
- **Roulette:** User guesses a number between 0 and 36, if they win, there is bet
multiplier of 35. Standard roulette has both 0 and 00. 00 is 37 since you can't
use 00.

###### Features Beyond Project Scope

- **Achievement tracking:** Similar to how it works in Xbox/PS4. Each 'medal'
is assigned a message and a rarity level (common, rare, very rare).

###### To-Do:

- [ ] More logic for input validation.
  - [ ] Move input validation logic to its own function, if possible.
  - [ ] Use lists, if possible, for acceptable words as input.
- [ ] Logic for achievement incrementing.
- [ ] Implement 'odd' or 'even' for roulette.
- [ ] Look into how a 'leader board' might work.
